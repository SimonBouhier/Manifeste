# Ordos - Fractal Modular AI Ecosystem

**Welcome to Ordos, a revolutionary system for managing modular AI architectures.**  
Ordos is designed to ensure alignment, modular independence, and self-correction of intelligent systems. It offers a structured, adaptive, and self-optimizing approach to AI system design.  

## ðŸ“˜ **Core Concepts**
- **Fractal Modularity**: Each part of the system reflects the alignment logic of the whole.  
- **Drift Control**: Automatic correction of deviations to ensure system stability.  
- **Self-Optimization**: Real-time dynamic adjustment for peak performance.
