Ordos - High-Level Architecture

1. GSM (Global Scenario Management)
   - Synchronize and prioritize global objectives
   - Dynamic adaptation of system-wide goals

2. GMS (Generalized Modular Separation)
   - Ensures module isolation for independent execution
   - Provides controlled interfaces for inter-module communication

3. GRO (Global Results Optimizer)
   - Collects results from all modules
   - Resolves conflicts using consensus mechanisms

4. CDI (Correction of Drift Inherent)
   - Detects and corrects misalignments between modules
   - Monitors drift thresholds and triggers escalations if needed

5. Hidden Modules (3 Confidential Modules)
   - These modules remain confidential to protect competitive advantages
